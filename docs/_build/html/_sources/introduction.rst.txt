Install PostgreSQL
------------------

With Admin / root
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

My favoured way to install PostgreSQL_ locally is the excellent distribution of
BigSQL. You can get `multi-platform installers`_ and *click through* the installation and get 'Start PostgreSQL` integration into your Windows Start Menu.
things.
This is convenient and especially likeable for Windows users. However, you will need admin
privileges.
(A similar alternative is offered by `EDB`_ which has a nice 'Stack Builder' solution for managing extensions.)

Without Admin / root
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

| Get the *multi-platform* `Postgres Package Manager`_ by BigSQL.
| Follow the instructions on that page. (Less than 5 commands...)

After you are ready, you can source the ``.env`` file (or execute :file:`/BigSQL/pgX.x/pg{X.x}-env.bat` .) So the `pgc`_ and ``psql`` commands get available globally.

If you did things right you can see the status, start, stop and more with:
::
	pgc status
	pgc start
	pgc stop

Adding PostGIS for geographical support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Regardless of how you installed the database, if you want to have geographical support
to your data. (Which we usually want with ``rivus``.) You can go ahead and add it to your BigSQL installation with their *pretty good command line tool*:
::
	pgc install postgis23-pg96

Create your database
---------------------

I like to first create my database schema visually. I use the *multi-platform* proprietary but freely and unrestrictedly evaluable `StarUML2`_ with its nice `PSQL plugin`_ which can generate PostgreSQL flavoured SQL code for the created diagram.

Such generated scripts can be found
