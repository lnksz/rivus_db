Install PostgreSQL
------------------

My favored way to install PostgreSQL_ locally, is the excellent distribution of
BigSQL. You can get `multi-platform installers <https://www.openscg.com/bigsql/postgresql/installers.jsp//>` and *click trough* the installation.
It is convenient, and especially likable for Windows users. However, you will need admin
privileges.
(Similar alternative is offered by `EDB <https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads/>` which has a nice 'Stack Builder' solution for managing extensions.)

For installation **without admin / root** privileges, get the *multi-platform* `Postgres Package Manager`_ by BigSQL.
