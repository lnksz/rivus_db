Overview
========

`rivus`_ is a cool open-source project, which is all about energy grid optimization with very high spatial resolution. (For that however with low time resolution.)

This repository is an extension for that project, to facilitate database integration.


Who uses rivus?
------------------

The project is still in an early phase, but as it was created and is maintained at the fabulous university of `TUM`_ there will be (hopefully) always somebody actively working with it.

Goals
------

I found that on the long run, and especially if one works with a lot of optimization parameters, a database (structured, queryable and accessible in a general, standard format as DBAPI) enables me to do much more with the data. As I strongly believe, that this method could be useful
in many other projects as well, I published and documented my work-flow.

It is nothing ground breaking nor is it the *"next big thing"* but hopefully it will empower some to shed their fear from databases and enable themselves to work more efficiently with more data. 

As such, this documentation also guide you through the database installation process. And gives some tips on the set-up.

Disclaimer
-----------
Usually, such a small repository would not need such an extensive documentation, but I decided to create this, as:

- I want to propose the easiest, most attractive way for individuals working with `rivus`_ to  the database world.
- I wanted to teach myself reStructuredText, Sphinx and the whole readthedocs work-flow.

Although, I thrive to publish useful, practical materials. All the code is provided "as is". No responsibility is taken for any caused errors.
